    <h1>Ingredients</h1>
    <ul>
      <li>2⅓ cup (280 g) unbleached all purpose flour</li>
      <li>¾ cup (75 g) Dutch-process or unsweetened cocoa powder.</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon baking soda</li>
      <li>¾ teaspoon Diamond Crystal kosher salt</li>
      <li>1 cup (1/2 lb;225 g) unsalted butter</li>
      <li>1 cup (200 g) granulated sugar</li>
      <li>1 cup (200 g) packed light brown sugar</li>
      <li>2 large eggs</li>
      <li>1½ teaspoons pure vanilla extract</li>
      <li>¾ cup (120 g) milk chocolate chips</li>
      <li>¾ cup (120 g) semisweet chocolate chips</li>
      <li>¾ cup (120 g) white chocolate chips</li>
    </ul>
    <h1>Steps</h1>
    <ol>
    <li>Preheat the oven to 350°F (176°C) with a rack in the center position. Line a large baking sheet with a silicone baking mat or parchment paper. Set aside.</li>
    <li>In a medium bowl, whisk together the flour, cocoa, baking soda, and salt. Set aside..</li>
    <li>In a bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a paddle attachment, combine the butter and both sugars. Mix until smooth, 2 minutes. Add the eggs one at a time, mixing well after each addition. Add the vanilla and mix until combined.</li> 
    <li>Gradually add the flour mixture and beat on low speed until just combined. Use a spatula to stir in the chocolate chips.</li>
    <li>Drop the dough by the rounded tablespoon on the prepared baking sheet, setting them apart by about 2 inches. Not all cookies will fit on the sheet for one batch. Bake for 10 minutes, rotating the pan halfway, until the cookies are set but still soft in the center. Do not overbake. While the cookies are warm, gently press extra chocolate chips into the cookies for presentation. Let the cookies cool on the baking sheet for 3 to 5 minutes before transferring to a rack to cool completely. Once the baking sheet has cooled, repeat with the remaining dough.</li>
    <li>Storage Tips: Store the cookes in an airtight container, between layers of parchment, at room temperature for up to 4 days or in the freezer for up to 1 month.</li>
