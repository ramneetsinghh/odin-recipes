    <h1>Description</h1>
    <h4>The Flaming Hot Pizza is exactly as the recipe name suggests. It is a complete random recipe name which I came up with. 
      Though, it turned out to be a real thing. The Flaming Hot Pizza consists of Pizza sauce, Jalepenos, Mushroom, Onion and spicy Italian sausage.
    It is a very simple recipe, takes about the same time to make as a regular pizza but it really is exceptional in terms of flavour. 
    It is spicy enough to a point where it doesn't overpower the flavour of the pizza but only enchanes the taste of it.</h4>
    <h1>Ingredients</h1>
    <ul>
      <li>1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil</li>
      <li>3 1/4 oucnes of spicy italian sausage or fresh chorizo removed from casing.</li>
      <li>Cornmeal, for dusting</li>
      <li>Whole-Wheat Pizza Dough</li>
      <li>5 ounces smoked mozzarella, cut into 1/4-inch-thick slices</li>
      <li>1/4 cup marinara sauce</li>
      <li>1 large jalaoeno cut into 1/4 slices, seeded</li>
      <li>1/4 small red onion, thinly sliced 'about 1/4 cup'</li>
    </ul>
    <h1>Steps</h1>
    <ol>
    <li>Place oven rack on lowest shelf. If you have a stone, place it on rack. Preheat oven to 550°F, or your oven's highest temperature, for 45 minutes.</li>
    <li>Warm 1 tsp. oil in a skillet over medium-high heat. Crumble sausage into skillet; sauté until no longer pink, 3 minutes. Transfer to a plate.</li>
    <li>Dust a 14-inch-wide pizza peel with cornmeal; flatten dough on top. Using lightly floured fingers or a floured rolling pin, stretch dough into a 13- to 14-inch round. 
      (Sprinkle peel with more cornmeal if necessary to make sure crust slides around easily on peel.) Brush remaining 2 tsp. oil over surface of crust.</li>
    <li>Arrange cheese over dough, leaving a 1-inch border. Spoon sauce in a spiral over pizza, getting a little bit on cheese, leaving a 1-inch border. Sprinkle on sausage, jalapeño and red onion.</li>
    <li>Carefully slide pizza onto stone. Bake until crust is just slightly charred on top and golden on bottom (lift an edge to check) and cheese has melted, about 8 minutes. Using peel, transfer pizza to a cutting board. Let rest for a minute or 2, then slice and serve.</li>
