    <h1>Description</h1>
    <h4>Chocolate Chip Muffins are known worldwide for their great taste and for their simplicity. Anyone from a kid to a grown adult, can enjoy this sweet.</h4>
    <h1>Ingredients</h1>
    <ul>
      <li> Milk: This moist chocolate chip muffin recipe starts with milk.</li>
      <li>Oil: Instead of butter, this recipe calls for a neutral oil (such as vegetable oil).</li>
      <li>Egg: An egg lends moisture and acts as a binder, which means it helps hold the batter together</li>
      <li>Flour: All-purpose flour gives the batter structure.</li>
      <li>Sugars: You'll need white and brown sugars for this sweet recipe.</li>
      <li>Baking powder: Baking powder acts as a leavener, which means it helps the batter rise.</li>
      <li>Salt: A pinch of salt enhances the overall flavor of the muffins, but it won't make them taste salty.</li>
      <li>Chocolate chips: Of course, you'll need chocolate chips!</li>
    </ul>
    <h1>Steps</h1>
